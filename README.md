# Udon3DPipes
An implementation of the classic Windows 3D Pipes screensaver, using VRchat's UdonSharp (a limited version of C#) and Unity.

Available to play in VRchat at https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_4765b90c-8c49-48c5-afa5-8dfdcebadad3.

This isn't a full repository of the VRchat world's Unity project, only the source files that control the logic for the pipes.
